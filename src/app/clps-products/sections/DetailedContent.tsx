        <p>
          Lightning is a high-energy electrical discharge between the
          atmosphere and the ground. The damage it causes to structures,
          equipment, and people falls into two broad categories. The first is
          direct physical damage. A lightning strike that terminates on a
          structure releases a large current — which may range from a few
          kiloamperes to several hundred kiloamperes depending on the severity
          of the event — into whatever path it finds to ground. If that path
          runs through the structural fabric of the building, through fuel or
          gas services, or through people in the vicinity, the consequences
          include fire, structural damage, explosion, and loss of life.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second is damage to electrical and electronic systems. Even when
          a strike does not contact a structure directly, the electromagnetic
          field associated with the lightning channel induces transient
          overvoltages onto cables and conductors within and around the
          building. These voltage spikes can destroy microelectronic
          components, corrupt data, cause equipment to fail in ways that are
          not immediately visible, and progressively shorten the service life
          of insulation systems and electronic assemblies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Modern industrial and commercial facilities are heavily dependent on
          electronic control systems, communications infrastructure, and data
          networks. The consequences of lightning damage to these systems
          extend well beyond the cost of the damaged equipment — they include
          production downtime, data loss, safety system unavailability, and
          regulatory non-compliance.
        </p>
        <p>
          A comprehensive lightning protection system addresses both
          categories of threat. The external system intercepts direct strikes
          and conducts their energy safely to ground. The internal system —
          equipotential bonding and surge protective devices — manages the
          overvoltages that would otherwise reach the electrical and
          electronic systems inside the building.

          IEC 62305 is the internationally adopted standard series for
          protection against lightning. Published in four parts, it covers the
          complete scope of lightning protection — from the initial risk
          assessment that determines whether protection is required, through
          the physical design of the external system, to the protection of
          internal electrical and electronic installations.
        </p>
        <p>
          The 2024 edition is a full technical revision of the previous 2010
          edition, developed over an extended period by international
          technical committees. It introduces updated risk assessment methods,
          revised design requirements for the external system, clearer
          guidance on separation distances, and strengthened requirements for
          the protection of electronic systems and photovoltaic installations.

        <p>
          IEC 62305:2024 treats lightning protection as a system with two
          interdependent parts. Each addresses a distinct category of threat,
          and neither is adequate on its own.
        </p>
        <p>
          The external lightning protection system manages the direct
          lightning strike event. It intercepts the strike at the air
          termination, provides a defined current path down the structure
          through the down conductor system, and disperses the energy safely
          into the ground through the earth termination. Its primary function
          is to protect the structure from physical damage and fire, and to
          prevent dangerous touch and step voltages in the vicinity of the
          building.
        </p>
        <p>
          The internal lightning protection system manages the electrical
          consequences of a strike within the building. It uses equipotential
          bonding to eliminate dangerous potential differences between the LPS
          conductors and the metallic services, structural elements, and
          electrical systems inside the structure. Surge Protective Devices
          installed on all electrical and electronic lines limit the transient
          overvoltages that enter the building — whether from the strike event
          or from internal switching activity — to levels that connected
          equipment can safely withstand.
        </p>
        <p>
          IEC 62305-3 requires that both parts of the comprehensive lightning
          protection system be maintained and periodically inspected after
          installation, with inspection intervals determined by the LPL and
          the environmental conditions at the site.
